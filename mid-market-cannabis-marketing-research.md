# Mid-Market Dispensary Playbook for Success

Mid-market dispensaries in Los Angeles and Portland succeed through **loyalty programs with 5% cashback rates, daily rotating category discounts (15-20% off), and SMS marketing achieving 98% open rates**—dramatically outperforming email's 20-25%. These dispensaries combine aggressive first-time customer offers (30-50% off) with automated retention campaigns targeting inactive customers, generating $115+ average tickets from win-back messages. The most profitable operations use cannabis-specific platforms like Klaviyo for email ($20-500/month), SpringBig for SMS ($500-2,000/month), and POS-integrated analytics dashboards tracking customer lifetime value, promotion ROI, and real-time inventory velocity. With California and Oregon's mature markets offering proven models at various price points, Texas dispensaries can now replicate these systems while adapting to local preferences and regulations.

This playbook synthesizes specific strategies from eight LA dispensaries and eight Portland dispensaries, alongside comprehensive analysis of marketing platforms, customer behavior patterns, and analytics requirements. Understanding these battle-tested approaches positions TerpHaus to capture mid-market customers seeking quality cannabis at competitive prices ($25-40 eighths, $150-180 ounces) while building long-term loyalty through data-driven, automated marketing systems.

## Promotional strategies that drive repeat business

The most successful mid-market dispensaries implement **structured daily deal rotations** rather than random promotions. Highway DTLA in South LA exemplifies this approach: Monday offers 15% off concentrates and wellness, Tuesday targets pre-rolls, Wednesday focuses on flower, Thursday highlights vapes, Friday promotes edibles, Saturday discounts merchandise, and Sunday provides 15% off the entire store. This predictable rotation trains customers to visit on specific days for their preferred products, increasing visit frequency by 20-30% compared to sporadic deals. The dispensary adds a 6am-8am happy hour with 15% off everything, capturing early morning customers and creating urgency.

**First-time customer offers range from 30-50% off**, with Highway DTLA offering 30%, Kush Alley providing 40%, and LAX Cannabis Club giving a $0.01 premium pre-roll when joining their loyalty program. Portland's dispensaries follow similar patterns, though some like Floyd's Fine Cannabis compete on everyday low prices (eighths as low as $3.50) rather than percentage discounts. Urban Farmacy in Portland runs a morning happy hour (10am-12pm) with 15% off purchases over $20, while Lucky Lion advertises products starting at $4/gram with $42 ounces available.

**BOGO (Buy-One-Get-One) and tiered deals** appear less frequently than percentage discounts but create significant traffic during promotional periods. Kush Alley runs BOGO for $1 promotions on select brands like Rove, Zen, Kanha, and Turn with minimum $50 purchases. Natural Remedies in Portland offers "Medible Mondays" for edibles specials, creating category-specific shopping days. Broadway Cannabis Market promotes itself as "premium without the price," positioning mid-market quality at accessible price points across its multiple Portland locations.

**Seasonal promotions around 420 (April 20) generate the highest annual revenue**, with dispensaries reporting lines out the door and 60-85% discounts on select items. Urban Farmacy's 420 weekend escalates discounts: Friday 15% off all day, Saturday 20% off all categories, Sunday 30% off all categories, with special ounce deals at $150-180 for premium brands. Other key promotional periods include Green Wednesday (day before Thanksgiving—second highest sales day annually), 7/10 (concentrate day), and standard holidays like Black Friday and New Year's.

**Referral programs** provide cost-effective customer acquisition. Kush Alley's structure gives referring customers 4 grams of house flower for $1 with purchase, while new referred customers receive 40% off their first purchase. Industry standards typically offer $10-20 credits for referrers and 20-30% off for new customers. Bridge City Collective in Portland promotes its referral program as part of its "best loyalty program in the USA" claim, though specific dollar amounts vary by location.

**Discount structures for special populations** appear universally: 10% off for seniors, students, and military members daily at most dispensaries. Catalyst Mid City offers these discounts in addition to rotating daily deals of 25-40% off popular brands. Natural Remedies automatically applies 15% off its in-house JD Grown brand flower, creating consistent value without complicated promotions.

## Client retention tactics that maximize lifetime value

**Points-based loyalty programs dominate mid-market dispensaries**, with the most competitive offering 4-5% cashback rates. Kush Alley's "Kush Ka$h" program leads the market at 5% return (1 point per $1 spent, 100 points = $5 off, 200 points = $10 off), compared to the industry standard of 2-3%. Broadway Cannabis Market offers 4% cashback (1 point per $1, $1 off for every 25 points), while Mint Cannabis and Lucky Lion both provide 5% cashback (200 points = $10 off). Legacy Kush takes a different approach with product rewards: 50 points for a free lighter, 250 points for a smoking kit, 1,000 points for a $100 goodie bag, and 1,500 points for a free 18" bong.

**Tiered loyalty programs** increase spending by rewarding high-value customers with multiplied points and exclusive perks. Bridge City Collective's VIP program offers 50-point welcome bonuses, member-only deals, early product access, and double-point events. Oregrown's "Lifted Rewards" includes 10% off on birthdays and point multiplier days with text alerts for exclusive offers. Industry standards typically advance tiers every $500-1,000 spent, with top tier requiring $2,500-5,000+ annual spending. Higher tiers receive 2x-3x point multipliers, priority customer service, private shopping hours, and invitations to special events.

**SMS/text marketing achieves 98% open rates with 93% opened within 3 minutes**, making it the highest-ROI channel—dramatically outperforming email's 20-25% open rates. A Los Angeles dispensary case study documented 14.92% conversion within 24 hours and 23.8% after one week from targeted SMS campaigns. Happy Cabbage's research shows a campaign to 21 customers with product-type affinity achieved 14.92% 24-hour conversion, while a campaign to 8,882 customers generated $17,867 in 24 hours through buying pattern segmentation. Win-back campaigns targeting lost customers (90+ days inactive) returned 12 customers generating $1,387 revenue with $115.58 average tickets.

**Best practices for SMS include segmentation by product preference** (flower, concentrates, edibles), location-based targeting (25-mile radius), purchase history, and frequency-based messaging (maximum 3-4 texts per week). Message types include daily deals, product restocks, new arrivals, exclusive text-only promotions, birthday rewards, and win-back campaigns. The best sending time is around 3pm Thursday-Saturday. Compliance requires double opt-in, age gates (21+), easy opt-out mechanisms (REPLY STOP), and avoiding cannabis keywords (weed, marijuana, THC) to prevent carrier blocking under SHAFT restrictions (Sex, Hate, Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco).

**Email campaigns complement SMS with educational content and longer-form promotions**. Welcome series sent upon signup achieve 4x higher open rates and 5x higher click-through rates than regular campaigns. Drip campaigns provide time-based educational sequences about strains, terpenes, and consumption methods. Nurture campaigns use behavior triggers like abandoned cart reminders, post-purchase follow-ups, and product recommendations based on history. Replenishment campaigns sent 30-60-90 days after purchase remind customers to restock consumables. Cannabis email marketing generates $38 return for every $1 spent (3,800% potential ROI), with 91% of U.S. consumers using email daily.

**Birthday and special occasion rewards** typically offer $10 off purchases, free pre-rolls or edibles, double loyalty points during birthday month, or exclusive product selections. Oregrown provides 10% off on birthdays. Anniversary rewards include first visit anniversary bonus points and membership anniversary discounts or free gifts. Personalized "we miss you" offers after 30-60 days of inactivity help recapture customers at 7x lower cost than acquiring new customers.

**Educational content builds trust and positions dispensaries as expert advisors** rather than just retailers. Urban Farmacy maintains an extensive blog covering strain effects, consumption methods, and industry news with their "Personalizing your cannabis journey" approach. Content strategies include strain education with terpene profiles, consumption method guides, dosage recommendations, product usage tips, industry news and legislation updates, and health and wellness content. Distribution channels include email newsletters, blog content, in-store consultations, social media (where permitted), and mobile app content.

## Marketing systems and platforms that work within regulations

**Klaviyo leads email marketing platforms for cannabis dispensaries**, fully cannabis-friendly with strong automation and segmentation capabilities. Pricing starts free for 250 contacts and 500 sends, scaling to $20/month for 500 subscribers with 5,000 sends. Klaviyo integrates seamlessly with Shopify, WooCommerce, BigCommerce, and Magento, offering pre-built automation workflows, real-time performance tracking, and design showcases. The major limitation: Klaviyo's parent company Twilio doesn't allow cannabis SMS, requiring a separate SMS platform.

**Alternative email platforms** include Moosend ($9/month for 500 subscribers with unlimited emails, 98% sender score), MailerLite (free up to 500 subscribers, $15/month for 2,500 subscribers with 30% annual discount), and HubSpot (comprehensive CRM with email, higher cost). Cannabis-specific Alpine IQ ($900-$1,200+ per store/month) combines email, SMS, and loyalty programs with direct POS integrations (Dutchie, Flowhub, Blaze, Treez) but costs significantly more. Platforms to avoid: Mailchimp (account bans reported after Intuit acquisition), SendinBlue (prohibits all cannabis), and Constant Contact (extremely limited—no product images or eCommerce).

**SpringBig dominates SMS marketing for cannabis**, purpose-built for the industry with 98% open rates and automatic audience segmentation. The platform ensures compliance with TCPA, CAN-SPAM, and CASL through double opt-in with age gates, automated campaigns, POS integration, website pop-ups, text-to-join keywords, and QR codes. Pricing is custom but typically $500-2,000/month for medium dispensaries. Alpine IQ also offers SMS (requires T-Mobile waiver), while LeafBuyer Technologies provides MMS support (images, videos) with 15-25% increased same-day foot traffic, 80% fewer opt-outs than SMS, and 15% higher click-through rates.

**SMS compliance requires careful attention** to avoid carrier blocking and legal issues. TCPA violations cost $500-$1,500 per unlawful message. Key requirements: express written consent before messaging, no cold-calling/texting potential customers, straightforward non-deceptive messaging matching content, opt-out instructions in every message, and 10DLC (10-Digit Long Code) vetting by carriers. CTIA guidelines prohibit cannabis-specific keywords under SHAFT restrictions, requiring creative wording to avoid flagging. Best practices include limiting audience sizes to under 5,000 per campaign for better deliverability, monitoring and honoring opt-out requests immediately, and including cost disclosures about message/data rates.

**Social media strategies require navigating platform restrictions** since direct cannabis advertising remains prohibited on major platforms. Twitter/X became the most cannabis-friendly in 2023, allowing advertising if licensed and pre-authorized, targeting only 21+ in legal states, with no online THC sales. LinkedIn doesn't censor cannabis content and allows advertising with restrictions (limit "cannabis" language, use cannabis-related images like someone smelling a jar, no direct sales). Instagram permits brand awareness, educational posts, and behind-the-scenes content but prohibits "cannabis" in bio, menu links in bio, price tags or SKUs in photos, consumption images, and direct sales language, with shadowbanning and account deletion risks. Facebook/Meta allows only non-ingestible hemp CBD product ads in the US with no THC product ads, though educational content and advocacy are permitted.

**Compliant social media content focuses on education and community** rather than sales. Successful content types include cannabis laws and regulations education, consumption methods and strain information (flavors, terpenes), cannabis culture and history, destigmatization content, behind-the-scenes staff spotlights, local events, customer stories (with permission), social justice initiatives, new product arrivals (without prices), brand features, growing/production processes, cannabis + food pairings, holiday content, wellness tips, and interactive polls, contests, Q&As, and user-generated content. Posting frequency recommendations: Twitter multiple times daily, Instagram 3-5 times per week, Facebook 3-4 times per week, LinkedIn 2-3 times per week. Instagram posts with images generate 2x more engagement, while Twitter threads generate 508% more engagement than single tweets.

**Content calendar best practices** allocate 40% educational content, 30% community/lifestyle, 20% product information, and 10% interactive content. Strategic themes cover cannabis holidays (4/20, 7/10, Green Wednesday), national holidays, product launches, educational series, and community events. All posts should include high-quality images/video with consistent brand aesthetics and mobile optimization. Instagram allows up to 30 hashtags (use all, vary each post), Twitter works best with 2-3 targeted hashtags, and LinkedIn responds to 3-5 professional hashtags. Examples: #cannabiscommunity, #cannabisculture, #medicalcannabis, #cannabispatient, #wellnesswednesday.

## Customer preferences that inform product selection and pricing

**Blue Dream dominates as California's #1 strain**, a hybrid with 21-26% THC offering balanced effects. Other top-selling classic strains include Wedding Cake (indica-hybrid, high THC, relaxation and euphoria), Gelato (balanced hybrid, sweet flavors), Sour Diesel (energizing sativa, 20-25% THC for daytime use), Northern Lights (classic indica, 21-28% THC for pain relief and sleep), Girl Scout Cookies (euphoric effects, unique flavor), and Gorilla Glue (potent hybrid, 25-30% THC with heavy effects). Emerging trendy strains include Lemon Cherry Gelato with candy-gas profile (extremely popular in 2024-2025), Ice Cream Cake (sedative indica), Apple Fritter (22-24% THC relaxation), Pineapple Express (energizing, 22-30% THC), Apples & Bananas (balanced hybrid, unique fruit profile), Runtz (sweet flavors, uplifting), and Cereal Milk (unique flavor, mental stimulation).

**Product category preferences show flower still dominates at 65%+ of Gen X purchases** and 40-50% overall sales, while vape pens capture 70.8% of Gen Z/Millennial purchases. Pre-rolls increased 11.9% in revenue June 2023-2024, now representing 25-30% of sales driven by convenience and infused options. Edibles comprise 15-20% of sales with top brands including Wyld, Drops, Grön, Magic Number, Happy Cabbage Farms, Blazy, and Camino Sours. **Microdosing products under 5mg THC per serving represent 15% of edible sales in 2024**, reflecting wellness-focused consumption trends. Concentrates (10-15% of sales) favor live resin, BHO, and rosin, while cannabis beverages emerge as the fastest-growing category valued at $1.2 billion in 2023 with 19.2% CAGR forecast through 2030, driven by Millennials and Gen Z viewing them as alcohol alternatives with nano-emulsification for faster effects.

**Mid-market price points and sweet spots** for flower: budget tier (high volume) at $3-5/gram and $30-60/oz, sweet spot at $6-9/gram and $80-120/oz, premium (aspirational) at $10-15/gram and $140-180/oz. Specific eighth (3.5g) pricing ranges $20-70 with sweet spot $25-40, matching TerpHaus's target market. Other products: pre-rolls $3-4 budget, $5-7 sweet spot, $8-12 premium, $10-20 infused; edibles $4-8 budget, $8-12 sweet spot, $12-20 premium; vape cartridges $25-60 for 1g; concentrates $10-15/gram budget, $15-25/gram sweet spot, $25-40/gram premium. Portland prices run 40-60% lower than 2017 due to Oregon's massive oversupply (3x more flower produced than consumed), with $7 grams now $3 and $160 ounces now $40-80 for budget outdoor.

**Shopping behaviors increasingly favor online ordering** with 60.5% preferring it based on Canadian studies applicable to U.S. markets, though in-store experience remains valued for consultation and immediate gratification. Delivery grows in popularity for convenience and privacy while pickup suits customers wanting immediate access. Same-day delivery is expected in competitive markets with free delivery common for $50-100 minimum orders. Decision-making factors prioritize customer service (highest weight), proximity/location, sales and discounts availability, product variety, product information quality, and online reviews and ratings. Regular customers visit 2-4 times per month, while loyalty program members visit 20-30% more frequently.

**Generational differences** show Millennials representing 46.2% of total sales (lead market) and Gen Z the fastest growing at 11.3% year-over-year increase (now 16.6% of market), combining for 62.8% of all sales. Younger consumers favor vape pens and mobile-first experiences with social media awareness. Gen X (65%+ buy flower) values customer service and appreciates classic strains. Baby Boomers focus on medical applications, CBD interest, chronic pain management, and prefer in-person education. Price and THC level rank as top 2 considerations at 58-60% each, with 39% purchasing less expensive alternatives to maintain consumption while 73% spend the same or more year-over-year.

## Analytics dashboards and tracking requirements for ROI optimization

**Core KPIs dispensaries track in real-time dashboards** include total sales by day/week/month/year, number of transactions, average sale amount (basket size), average unit retail (value per item sold), discounts applied (inline vs. auto-applied vs. manual), traffic flow patterns (peak hours, busy days, bottlenecks), top-performing products by sales velocity and revenue, inventory levels and reorder flags, customer acquisition sources, employee performance by sales and transactions, and promotion effectiveness by ROI. Flowhub's Store Dashboard allows managers to "identify revenue opportunities and make intelligent business decisions" by presenting complicated data in visual, digestible formats.

**Customer segmentation capabilities** enable targeted campaigns generating 3x revenue versus mass blasts. Essential segments include purchase history (product preferences like flower vs. edibles vs. concentrates), visit frequency (daily, weekly, monthly shoppers), spending tiers (budget, mid-market, premium customers), recency (active, at-risk, lost customers), demographics (age, location within 25-mile radius), and product affinity (concentrate buyers, edible consumers, flower enthusiasts). Alpine IQ and SpringBig offer algorithmic targeting and machine learning segmentation to identify audiences most likely to convert, with Happy Cabbage using AI to predict optimal segments while minimizing opt-out rates.

**Automated campaign triggers** dramatically improve retention while reducing manual work. Win-back campaigns trigger after 30, 60, or 90 days of inactivity with special offers to recapture customers at 7x lower cost than acquisition. Replenishment reminders send after typical consumption cycles (30-60-90 days depending on product) to prompt restocking. Birthday campaigns automatically send during birthday month with 10-20% discounts or free items. Purchase-based triggers send cross-sell recommendations based on what customers bought (e.g., edible buyers receive dosage tips and complementary product suggestions). Welcome series trigger upon signup with 4x open rates and 5x CTR, including brand story, product category overview, first-time discount codes, and educational content links. Abandoned cart campaigns recover lost online orders.

**Marketing attribution and ROI tracking** identify which channels drive revenue to optimize budget allocation. MediaJel's cannabis marketing dashboard tracks impressions, click-throughs, CTR, sign-ups, and revenue with click attribution across the buyer's non-linear journey. Data updates every 20 minutes with revenue and ROAS refreshed at midnight PST. By adding pixels to websites and eCommerce platforms, dispensaries track which creatives were served, impression counts, devices ads were seen on, and inventory leading to purchases—revealing where customers spend time online to optimize campaigns based on data, inventory, and creative performance.

**Essential analytics platforms and integrations** start with POS systems providing core sales data (Dutchie, Flowhub, Blaze, Treez, Cova). Cannabis-specific analytics providers include Headset (3,500+ retail partners providing market intelligence, sales tracking, inventory optimization, and retailer-direct data sharing), BDSA (comprehensive market size and consumer insights including Hemp and Delta consumers), and Qredible (real-time analytics for optimizing dispensary operations). POS-integrated dashboards from Cova, Dutchie, and C-Trax Serv provide customizable reporting, mobile access from anywhere, fraud detection through unusual pattern identification, and scheduled reports (daily/weekly/monthly) to reduce manual work.

**Email and SMS performance metrics** track open rates (email 20-25%, SMS 98%), click-through rates (email 2-3%, SMS 15-25%), conversion rates by campaign, revenue attribution by channel (best-in-class email drives 20-40% of total revenue), unsubscribe/opt-out rates (MMS shows 80% fewer opt-outs than SMS), and engagement timing (SMS opened within 90 seconds 90% of the time). A/B testing capabilities compare subject lines, content formats, sending times, and offers. Campaign ROI tracking shows SMS generating 15-25% same-day foot traffic increases while email achieves 3,800% potential ROI.

**Customer lifetime value (CLV) and retention metrics** include purchase frequency, average order value over time, retention rate by cohort, churn rate and causes, loyalty program engagement (point accrual and redemption rates), and net promoter score. Industry benchmarks show 20% of customers generating 80% of revenue (Pareto principle), loyalty program members delivering 3.5x more annual revenue, and customer acquisition costing 7x more than retention. Dispensaries using segmented email campaigns see 22% increase in conversion rates and 30% improvement in average order value according to Flowhub reports.

**Recommended tech stack by business size** for small dispensaries (1 location, under 10,000 customers): MailerLite or Moosend for email ($15-50/month), LeafBuyer or SpringBig for SMS (custom pricing), organic social media managed in-house, total $500-1,500/month. Medium dispensaries (2-5 locations, 10K-50K customers): Klaviyo for email ($100-500/month), SpringBig or Alpine IQ for SMS ($500-2,000/month), professional social media management, total $2,000-5,000/month. Large/multi-state operators (5+ locations, 50K+ customers): Klaviyo or Alpine IQ for email and CRM ($1,000-5,000/month), enterprise SMS solutions, full agency social media management, total $10,000-30,000+/month.

## Actionable recommendations for TerpHaus in Austin

**Implement a 5% cashback loyalty program immediately** to match the most competitive dispensaries like Kush Alley and Lucky Lion. Structure it as 1 point per $1 spent with 200 points = $10 off redemption. Add a 50-point welcome bonus for new members and birthday month 10% discounts. Consider tiered advancement at $1,000, $2,500, and $5,000 annual spending with 1.5x, 2x, and 3x point multipliers respectively for top tiers. Budget $2,000-5,000/month for a mid-tier loyalty + SMS platform like SpringBig that integrates with your POS system.

**Launch daily deal rotations** following Highway DTLA's proven model: assign each day of the week to a different category (Monday flower, Tuesday edibles, Wednesday concentrates, Thursday vapes, Friday pre-rolls, Saturday full-store discount, Sunday new customer day). Set discounts at 15-20% per category to maintain margin while driving traffic. Add an early morning happy hour (7am-9am) or late evening (7pm-9pm) with 15% off entire purchases to capture customers during slower periods. Create predictable patterns so customers know when to visit for their preferred products.

**Build SMS and email lists aggressively from day one** since SMS achieves 98% open rates versus email's 20-25%. Use in-store QR codes, website pop-ups with age verification, text-to-join keywords, and tablet sign-ups at checkout. Offer 30-40% off first purchase as immediate incentive. Select Klaviyo for email ($20-100/month initially) and SpringBig for SMS ($500-1,500/month for single location). Send 3-4 SMS messages per week maximum focused on daily deals, flash sales, new arrivals, and exclusive text-only promotions. Send 1-2 emails per week with longer-form educational content, weekly deal summaries, and strain spotlights. Always include double opt-in, age gates, and easy opt-out mechanisms for compliance.

**Stock trending strains that mid-market customers request**: Blue Dream (must-have #1), Lemon Cherry Gelato (extremely hot in 2024-2025), Wedding Cake, Gelato, Sour Diesel, Girl Scout Cookies, and Gorilla Glue as core offerings. Price eighths in the $25-40 sweet spot, with ounces at $150-180 for premium and $80-120 for mid-tier. Offer budget options ($30-60/oz for value-seekers) to capture price-sensitive customers while maintaining margin on premium products. Ensure broad product mix: 40-50% flower, 25-30% pre-rolls (including infused options), 15-20% edibles (prioritize microdose products under 5mg for wellness trend), 10-15% concentrates, 10-15% vape cartridges, plus emerging cannabis beverages to capture Millennial/Gen Z alcohol-alternative seekers.

**Set up automated campaign triggers immediately** to maximize retention at 7x lower cost than acquisition. Configure win-back campaigns for 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day inactive customers with escalating offers ($10 off, 20% off, 30% off respectively). Create replenishment reminders triggering 30 days after flower purchases, 45 days after edible purchases, and 60 days after concentrate purchases. Set up abandoned cart campaigns for online orders. Build welcome series sending 3 emails over first 14 days: Day 1 welcome with first-purchase discount, Day 5 product education and consumption tips, Day 14 loyalty program explanation and referral invitation. These automated workflows require initial setup but then run perpetually, generating revenue while you sleep.

**Establish compliant social media presence** focusing on education and community rather than direct sales. Create Instagram and Facebook accounts without "cannabis" in bio or menu links, posting 3-5 times weekly with behind-the-scenes content, staff spotlights, cannabis education, new product announcements (without prices), and customer stories. Use Twitter/X for more direct advertising since it became cannabis-friendly in 2023, though you'll need pre-authorization. Avoid consumption imagery, price tags, and direct sales language. Allocate content as 40% educational, 30% community/lifestyle, 20% product information, 10% interactive. Build email/SMS lists as insurance against social media account loss since platforms can ban accounts without notice.

**Deploy real-time analytics dashboard from day one** using POS-integrated solutions like Dutchie, Flowhub, or Cova with mobile access. Track daily sales, transactions, average basket size, discount percentages, traffic flow patterns, top products by velocity, inventory levels, employee performance, and customer acquisition sources. Set up automated weekly reports emailed to management summarizing key metrics and flagging concerns like unusual discount patterns (fraud detection), low-stock items needing reorders, and declining product categories. Use customer segmentation to identify your top 20% of customers generating 80% of revenue and create VIP campaigns targeting them specifically with early product access and exclusive offers.

**Competitive positioning for Austin's Texas market** should emphasize quality at accessible prices since you'll compete against illicit market pricing pressures similar to California and Oregon. Highlight compliance, safety testing, and expert budtender education as differentiators from unregulated sources. Position between budget dispensaries (competing solely on price) and luxury dispensaries (premium products at high margins) by offering "premium without the price" like Broadway Cannabis Market. Stock multiple price tiers within each category so customers self-select based on budget while seeing aspirational premium options they might upgrade to over time. Lead with customer service and education since these rank as highest-weight decision factors for dispensary selection, ahead of price and product variety.

**Test and optimize continuously** using A/B testing for email subject lines (personalized subjects achieve 26% higher open rates), SMS sending times (3pm Thursday-Saturday performs best), promotional discount percentages (15% vs. 20% vs. 25% on daily deals), and loyalty program reward tiers. Track promotion ROI ruthlessly—fund winning campaigns and refine underperformers. Monitor metrics weekly: if email open rates drop below 20% or SMS below 95%, investigate deliverability issues or content fatigue. If average basket size declines, implement budtender upselling training and cross-selling prompts at checkout. If customer visit frequency decreases, increase SMS urgency with time-limited flash sales and gamify loyalty programs with double-point days.

**Budget allocation for first year** of marketing operations: Loyalty + SMS platform $6,000-18,000/year, email marketing platform $240-1,200/year, social media management (in-house initially or agency) $0-12,000/year, analytics and reporting tools (included in POS) $0, professional photography and content creation $2,000-5,000/year, total marketing tech stack $8,240-36,200/year representing 1-3% of projected revenue for a successful mid-market dispensary. Expect 20-40% of total revenue attributable to email marketing and 15-25% same-day foot traffic increases from SMS campaigns, generating 10-15x ROI on marketing technology investments when executed properly with segmentation, automation, and continuous optimization.
